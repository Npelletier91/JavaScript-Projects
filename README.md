# JavaScript Projects

This repository includes various JavaScript exercises I have learned while at The Tech Academy. Below are some of the projects that showcase my learning and progress.

## Projects

### 1. Calculator

A simple calculator built using JavaScript functions. This project has been a great learning experience, and it allowed me to understand fundamental concepts such as functions, event handling, and basic arithmetic operations.

### 2. Pizza Website

The Pizza Website is a simple web page for ordering and managing pizza orders. It demonstrates my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website provides an intuitive user interface to place orders and keep track of them, making it a fun and interactive project.

### 3. Tic-Tac-Toe Game

The Tic-Tac-Toe game is built with JavaScript and includes a computer player that makes random moves. Implementing this game provided me with insights into logic implementation, game state management, and handling user interactions.

### 4. React, AJAX, and jQuery Examples

In these projects, I explore various examples of using React, AJAX, and jQuery. These technologies are essential for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. The examples showcase my proficiency in working with these popular front-end frameworks and libraries.

These projects reflect my continuous growth and dedication to learning JavaScript and web development. I'm excited to share my progress and look forward to expanding my skills further through more challenging projects in the future.

Feel free to explore the individual project folders for the source code and additional details.
